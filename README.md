# hci-project-edu-game

My educational roguelike project for HCI. Crawl through dark dungeons and fight evil monsters as the brave Mathemagician! 

TODO: General cleanup and upload the remaining modules

WARNING: Executable in gia_ergastirio.rar is out of date! 
Bundling new versions of my game to exe seems to cause runtime errors. Gotta look into that.
For the time being you can either play the old version in the rar or download pygame yourself and try the latest one
