# hci-project-edu-game



My educational roguelike project for HCI. Crawl through dark dungeons and fight evil monsters as the brave Mathemagician! Excuse the terrible and "un-pythony" coding, this is not how I usually develop. This repository is more of a scratchpad for me to test new features for the game.The code will eventually be cleaned and documented.

Most of the art is either by me or from open source art assets and all music and sound effects are by me using open source soundfonts to render them.

TODO: General cleanup and upload the remaining modules

WARNING: Executable in gia_ergastirio.rar is out of date! 
Bundling new versions of my game to exe seems to cause runtime errors. Gotta look into that.
For the time being you can either play the old version in the rar or download pygame yourself and try the latest one
